// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.



function storeCar(manufacturer:string,modelName:string,...extraOption: { [key : string] : any } []){
    const carinfo = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign( {}, ...extraOption)
    }

    return carinfo;
};

let ans = storeCar('honda','civic',{color:'black'},{featyres:['navigation','Power Window']});
console.log(ans)
