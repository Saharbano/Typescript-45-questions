// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function storeCar(manufacturer, modelName, ...extraOption) {
    const carinfo = {
        manufacturer,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...extraOption)
    };
    return carinfo;
}

let ans = storeCar('honda', 'civic', { color: 'black' }, { featyres: ['navigation', 'Power Window'] });
console.log(ans);
